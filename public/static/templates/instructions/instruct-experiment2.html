      You will see many mazes with different color goals and these colors will
      be repeated throughout the game. The color of a maze controls the rules of
      the maze, determining both which keys move you around in the maze and
      which goal is valuable.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      You will have to learn the rules but for each color, the rules are always
      the same. For example, if you find that the button "j" moves the blue
      circle up, it will do so in every square and maze with a blue circle.
      Likewise, if you learn that the "A" goal is worth 10 points in a green
      maze, "A" will be worth 10 points in every other green maze you see.
